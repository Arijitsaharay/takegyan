# Description: 
The theme TakeGyan is very eminent in nature because TakeGyan means spreading knowledge which is done by every single individual in the society, like a teacher to the student, parents to their children, a senior to its junior, etc. We choose this theme to work on the same and put forward a new method or process to spread knowledge and lend a helping hand to others. In recent days what we came across is most of the students are into online classes because it is the only way out to overcome the present situation. But online learnings are quite difficult for the students to have a one on one session with their teachers to clarify their doubts. So we tried implementing a module where students can have one-on-one sessions to clarify their doubts from their teachers. In this case, we have also considered the availability of the teachers to schedule a meeting with the student having any doubt.
